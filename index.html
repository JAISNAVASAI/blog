                <p class="text-muted text-left">At Litera valley Zee School, our resolute determination is to never settle for anything less than the best. We provide the best in infrastructure, technology, and facilities and right within the first year of operation, we were 200-student strong. Which led the school to bag the Best School Award in 2011. And no, we are not ones to rest on our laurels at all. Much as we were thrilled by the honour, the school management decided to build upon the accomplishments of the first year to better and greater heights. Now, the school houses over 1500 students, with more scheduled to join us soon. We know that this has been a reward for clear vision and well-defined goals. The management has always been proven to provide the best and the latest in technology. Every classroom has been smartly equipped with Interactive White Boards from Ireland. Additionally, the ActivInspire software is designed to provide extra resources for use by the teachers. </p>

                <h1>LANGUAGE LAB</h1>
                <p>Language is not a subject. This is the statement we abide by, as language learning is different from the way students learn other subjects. Developing a good command over the English language for every child on campus is one of the prime moto of the school as a person with great knowledge and zero effective communication skills is found to be absolute in today’s world. In order to develop our students’ vocabulary and to groom them as well-grounded personalities who not only excel in their field of specialization but also in having a compelling command over the English language, many special programs like Public Speaking, Spell Right, Pronounce Right and Speak Right are introduced. Through these programs, children develop their English language skills extensively.
